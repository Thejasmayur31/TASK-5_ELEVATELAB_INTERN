# TASK-5_ELEVATELAB_INTERN
In this task, we applied tree-based machine learning models to classify heart disease using a medical dataset. We trained and visualized a Decision Tree classifier to understand its decision-making process and controlled overfitting by limiting the tree depth. We then implemented a Random Forest model, which outperformed the Decision Tree in terms of accuracy and robustness. Feature importance analysis highlighted the most influential medical attributes affecting predictions. Cross-validation was used to ensure model reliability and generalization. The project was implemented using Scikit-learn, with visualizations via Matplotlib and Seaborn.
